## Kit Lavis

Hi all! I'm Kit, a former archaeologist turned developer, currently studying with the Code Institute and searching for my entry into the profession. I'm constantly seeking oppurtunities for self-improvement and skill-development, and I revel in the idea of one day combining my experience in the archaeology industry with my ever-improving development skills. So please, feel free to flick through my repositories, and maybe we will collaborate in the future!
