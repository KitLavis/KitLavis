## Kit Lavis

I am a driven and determined junior developer, currently completing the Code Institute's full-stack software development diploma. I hope to combine my previous exposure to geospatial systems from my time as an archaeologist - namely using ArcGIS to process data gathered from geospatial and geophysical survey - with my ever-improving development skills, in order to find my entry into the industry.

I decided to change careers as the path I was on did not align with how I foresaw my future. Hard work and determination on this new path may eventually lead to greater flexibility in terms of remote work, allowing my partner and I to spend more time in our home countries of England and Sardinia.
