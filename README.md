## Kit Lavis

I am a driven and determined junior developer who has recently completed the Code Institute's full-stack software development diploma. I hope to combine my previous exposure to GIS from my time as an archaeologist with my ever-improving development skills, in order to find my entry into the industry. I believe my communication skills and adaptability make me a great addition to any development team.
