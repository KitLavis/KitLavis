## Kit Lavis

Hi there! I'm Kit, an archaeologist turned developer, currently studying with the Code Institute and searching for my entry into the profession.

I'm constantly seeking opportunities for self-improvement and skill-development, and I revel in the idea of one day combining my knowledge and passion for archaeology with my ever-improving development skills.
